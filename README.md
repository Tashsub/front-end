## Introduction

The Front End Engineer Exam is designed to help you showcase your front end engineering skills. We are interested to see how you work and what your thought process is, there is no single correct way to complete the task.

The task is to take the Figma design specification provided in this folder and turn it into a working prototype React application using the provided mock API.

The prototype application should enable the user to view their portfolio of sites in a list and on a map, the user should also be able to sort their sites by name and size. Each site in the list should enable the user to click through to a site page where the individual information for that site will be displayed.

There are 2 tests within the app component folder that we require you to complete using react testing library.

The site power is provided by the API as a number in Watts, you will need to convert this into Megawatts (1 MW = 1000000 W). 

### Map
A google map react plugin is installed as part of the dependencies, you don't have to use this but if you wish to the documentation is [here](https://react-google-maps-api-docs.netlify.app/).
